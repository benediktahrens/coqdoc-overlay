coqdoc-overlay is a collection of scripts to improve the output of coqdoc, the
documentation generation tool for the Coq proof assistant.

Alignment: preserves alignment similarly to what is done by lhs2TeX. To use it,
pass the HTML file generated by coqdoc to the perl script alignment.pl.

Proofs toggle: transforms the Coq command Proof. into a link to display or hide
the proofs. To use it, pass the HTML file generated by coqdoc to the sed script
proofs-toggle.sed and add links to jQuery and proofs-toggle.js to it.
